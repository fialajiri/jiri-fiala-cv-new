MY STORY
--------
Picture this: It's 2020, the world is in lockdown, and while many were learning to bake sourdough bread, I was discovering something far more fulfilling‚Äîthe art of turning ideas into digital reality through code. What started as a weekend hobby during those uncertain times became the catalyst for a complete career transformation.

Today, I stand as a passionate full-stack developer with over 4 years of hands-on experience, but my story doesn't begin there. My journey spans more than a decade of analytical excellence‚Äî8+ years of dissecting complex problems, crafting strategic solutions, and leading diverse teams across various industries. This unique combination of analytical rigor and technical prowess has shaped me into a developer who doesn't just write code, but understands the business logic behind every line.

The COVID pandemic didn't just change the world‚Äîit changed me. It was during those quiet, introspective months that I realized programming wasn't just a hobby; it was my calling. The satisfaction of solving problems, the joy of creating something from nothing, the endless learning opportunities‚ÄîI knew I couldn't imagine doing anything else.

What sets me apart isn't just my technical skills in React.js, Next.js, Node.js, and TypeScript, but my ability to bridge the gap between complex business requirements and elegant technical solutions. I don't just build applications; I craft experiences that solve real-world problems for real people.

üåü THE STORY CONTINUES
Where We Go From Here

Every great story has a beginning, a middle, and an exciting future. My journey from numbers to code, from analysis to application, from theory to practice‚Äîit's all been leading to this moment.

I'm not just a developer who writes code; I'm a problem-solver who understands that every technical challenge is really a human challenge. My 8+ years of analytical experience didn't just teach me to read data‚Äîit taught me to read people, to understand what they really need, even when they can't articulate it themselves.

My 3+ years in full-stack development have given me the technical skills to turn those insights into reality. React.js, Next.js, Node.js, TypeScript‚Äîthese aren't just tools in my toolkit; they're the brushes I use to paint digital solutions that make a real difference.

From protecting national security with the Czech Police to empowering energy customers with EON, from streamlining enterprise operations with TAS to connecting citizens with their local government‚Äîevery project has been a chapter in a larger story about using technology to solve real problems for real people.

But here's the thing about good stories: they don't end. They evolve. They grow. They lead to new adventures, new challenges, new opportunities to make a difference.

The question isn't what I've accomplished‚Äîit's what we can accomplish together. Because the best stories are the ones we write together.
